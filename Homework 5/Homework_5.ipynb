    "<font color='red'>__Question__</font>: Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have recently developed a dataset for the prupose of data-driven design of a bicycle. In the long run, the goal is to use this dataset to train models that are capable of desgning bicycles based on given features. In this homework assignment, we try to use KNN method to classify the type of a given bicycle using the given features. There is a great video giving explanations regarding these researchers' work at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75GpGV6M8VU, which I encourage you to watch to get a better understandng of the dataset. Further, you can also find their published paper at https://decode.mit.edu/assets/papers/BIKED.pdf. Both the video and the paper provide information about how did they create the dataset and some of their modeling results."
