    "For this homework, we use the dataset BIKED, which you were introduced to it before. The only difference in this dataset is that the column Bicycle Model's name has changed into Bike Class. This dataset includes 4,512 manually-designed bicycle models. The goal of the dataset developers is to enable a variety of data-driven design applications for bicycles and support the development of data-driven design methods. The dataset is comprised of a variety of design information including assembly images, component images, numerical design parameters, and class labels. The text explaining the dataset and the figure are coming from paper: https://decode.mit.edu/assets/papers/BIKED.pdf. The dataset include 19 different styles of bicycles. Figure 1 shows a list of styles and the number of samples (and the percentages) for each style in the original dataset. Mountain bikes are abbreviated as \"MTB\". Bikes classified as \"OTHER\" are labelled as such by the designer. The \"Remaining Label Categories\" group contains the remaining 10 explicit categories in descending order of prevalence: BMX, CITY, COMMUTER, CRUISER, HYBRID, TRIALS, CARGO, GRAVEL, CHILDRENS, FAT."
